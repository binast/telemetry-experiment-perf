# About

An opt-in experiment to determine the performance impact of BinAST on browsing

# Target of this extension

This extension is designed to be active for a limited time,
for a subset of the PIONEER population of *Firefox testers*,
willing to contribute to measuring the performance impact of BinAST on browsing.

Due to the possibility of privacy leaks, this extension is **not** meant for the general user base.
If you do not know about the privacy risks of using this extension, please do **not** install it.
Really.

# What this extension does

Whenever the user loads a page from one of the target websites (currently, facebook.com, instagram.com), this extension
measures the duration of the load and determines whether the page was using BinAST code.

It then uploads the performance data to Mozilla.

By comparing the performance between users who receive BinAST and users who don't, this lets Mozilla
estimate the performance impact of BinAST on browsing.
